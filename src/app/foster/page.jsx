        Fostering a dog saves a life. If you would like to help us by fostering
        a dog please fill out our Foster Application. Foster care consists of
        providing a safe, loving, temporary home for a dog until a permanent
        adoptive home can be found. All dogs are screened for health and
        temperament before entering our program. We can only rescue as many dogs
        as we have foster homes!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide temporary home for the dog.</li>
        <li>
          Be patient. Understand that all dogs are rescue dogs and their
          behavior can be unpredictable. Be prepared for some adjustment in the
          beginning. It can be stressful for both you and the dog to be in a new
          situation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be willing to foster your dog from rescue to adoption. The amount of
          time needed to find a permanent home for a dog can vary from weeks to
          months.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are working full time, provide a safe indoor place for the dog
          to be while you are gone. For the Love of Labs Rescue highly
          recommends crate training to keep both the dog and your home safe and
          secure. We will provide a crate if requested.
        </li>
        <li>
          Foster homes sign a Foster Agreement and agree to abide by For the
          Love of Labs Rescue policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Notify your For the Love of Labs Rescue contacts immediately in the
          event the dog is sick or lost (your foster agreement includes the
          names and numbers of your contacts). Take the dog to medical
          appointments as required.
        </li>
        <li>
          Notify your For the Love of Labs Rescue contacts when you are going on
          vacation so we can provide another home for your dog to go to. Taking
          your foster dog with you also requires permission.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep For the Love of Labs Rescue informed about your foster dogâ€™s
          personality, quirks, behavior, etc. Your input is invaluable for
          describing the dog on the website and to potential adopters.
        </li>
        <li>Treat the dog as a member of your family.</li>

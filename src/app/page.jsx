            We are a foster based rescue, dedicated to the rescue of labs and
            lab mixes in danger of euthanasia. We are a 501(c)3 organization
            based in Connecticut. Our group is comprised of volunteers in the
            Eastern US who love labs and want to help those that end up homeless
            through no fault of their own.

            To the best of our ability, we evaluate all of our dogs temperament
            and suitability for living with other dogs, cats, and children. Our
            dogâ€™s health is checked, and they are brought current on all
            vaccinations and are spayed or neutered. We then place them in
            loving foster homes until they find their very own family. Our goal
            is to meet the needs of each dog as an individual and to assure
            proper placement in a loving forever home.

            Our labs live in loving foster homes until their perfect forever
            home is found. Our foster homes work with our dogs to determine
            temperament as well as the requirements for each specific dog so
            that we can place them in a home that will fit their needs.
